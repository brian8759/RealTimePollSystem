RealTimePollSystem
==================

Apply "MEAN" stack to create a real time poll system.
Use MongoDB as the database storage.
Use Node.js and express.js to make the back end. 
Use Mongoose as the connection layer between Node.js and MongoDB.
Use Angular.js to do the front end.


I found it is really unconvenient to combine express 4 with socket.io
